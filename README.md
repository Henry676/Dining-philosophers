# Dining-philosophers
This is a project where I implemented multithreading concepts into the classic problem "The dining philosophers" where every philosopher is just a Thread. Every philosopher needs to wait, think, eat and sleep. In this problem, 2 philosophers must be eating, no more no less. Just 2 eating at the same time because the shared resources are the pair of forks for each Philosopher as long as the are avalaible forks for every Philosopher because if a Philosopher wants to eat, it must be the pair of forks available for him.
